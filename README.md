# task_manager_app
The application was designed based on a clean code mechanism, and the code was divided into three main folders, which are:
app contains the main files in the project
resources and contains general files that can be used in any project
features and contains project services, meaning each service will have its own folder containing three layers, which are data, domain, and presentation

The project is ready in all respects
But I did not do unit testing
